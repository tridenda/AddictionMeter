AddictionMeter
AddictionMeter is a native mobile application designed to help users assess their level of addiction—specifically porn addiction—using the Certainty Factor (CF) algorithm. This app was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis in Computer Science.

Features
📊 Addiction Detection
Analyze and detect the level of addiction using the Certainty Factor algorithm, a knowledge-based approach to handle uncertainty in decision-making.

🔐 User Authentication
Register and log in with your email. The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure and reliable account management.

☁️ Realtime Database Integration
User data and diagnostic results are stored and updated in Firebase, ensuring a smooth and scalable data flow.

Technologies Used
⚛️ React Native with Expo
Built with React Native and Expo to support fast development and cross-platform capabilities.

🔥 Firebase
Used for authentication, database, and real-time data syncing.

🧠 Certainty Factor Algorithm
The core diagnostic system uses the Certainty Factor method to estimate the likelihood of addiction based on user inputs.

About the Project
This application was created as part of my final project and undergraduate thesis at UBP Karawang. It aims to provide a supportive tool for individuals to self-assess addiction levels with a scientific, rule-based approach.
