# AddictionMeter

**AddictionMeter** is a native mobile application designed to help users assess their level of addiction—specifically porn addiction—using the **Certainty Factor (CF)** algorithm. This app was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis in Computer Science.

## 📱 Features

- **Addiction Detection**  
  Analyze and detect the level of addiction using the **Certainty Factor algorithm**, a knowledge-based approach to handle uncertainty in decision-making.

- **User Authentication**  
  Register and log in with your email. The app uses **Firebase Authentication** for secure and reliable account management.

- **Realtime Database Integration**  
  User data and diagnostic results are stored and updated in **Firebase**, ensuring a smooth and scalable data flow.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React Native with Expo**  
  Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to support fast development and cross-platform capabilities.

- **Firebase**  
  Used for authentication, database, and real-time data syncing.

- **Certainty Factor Algorithm**  
  The core diagnostic system uses the Certainty Factor method to estimate the likelihood of addiction based on user inputs.

## 📚 About the Project

This application was created as part of my final project and undergraduate thesis at UBP Karawang. It aims to provide a supportive tool for individuals to self-assess addiction levels with a scientific, rule-based approach.
